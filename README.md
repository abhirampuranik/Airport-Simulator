# Airport-Simulator
This is a C program that simualates an actual airport with one runway and spaws aeroplanes (that have to land or take off) using Poisson's distribution.
The value of the amount of time the simulation needs to run and the lambda(in Poisson's distribution) needs to be provided in the beginning.

Execution on windows: `mingw32-make -f filename.mk`
